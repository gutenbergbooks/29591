<p>You probably know that it was a Queen of Spain, Isabella, who made it
possible for America to be discovered in 1492. It was an Italian sailor,
Christopher Columbus, who first had the strange new idea that he could
sail westward from Spain in order to reach the Far East. He came to
Spain to tell people about his idea, and everybody he met thought he was
crazy because they knew, or thought they knew, that the northern corner
of Spain, jutting out into the Atlantic, was the very end of the world.
Even the most daring sailors and fishermen wouldn't go very far from
that shore for fear they would drop over the rim into nothingness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>But Queen Isabella didn't think Columbus was crazy. She took time to
listen to him and decided she wanted to help him. She didn't have any
money to buy ships for his expedition, so she ordered a little fishing
village, Palos, to build three ships as a way of paying a fine they owed
her. The fishermen of Palos knew how to build good, sturdy sailing
vessels, and they soon had the three ships ready for Columbus and his
brave sailors.</p>

<p>That is why, in August of 1492, the daring expedition started from this
little Spanish village. What a sight! Three little ships, the <i>Ni&ntilde;a</i>
(Small Girl), the <i>Pinta</i> (Spotted), and the <i>Santa Maria</i> (named in
honor of the Virgin Mary) cast off from the wharf of Palos. Flags
fluttered in the breeze as the sails billowed out from the masts. All
the villagers were lined up on the shore to pray and to cheer, and the
bells in the church rang as Columbus and his crew sailed off "the rim"
to the west in search of wealth and glory for Spain!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</div>

<p>Many Spanish explorers followed Columbus to the New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> World, and even
sailed all the way around the world, west to east, but the Spanish
people today are mostly "stay-at-homes." Sometimes they leave home for a
little while to make money, like the Spanish shepherds who are so good
at handling flocks of sheep that American ranchers in California, New
Mexico, Nevada and other western states pay them a lot of money to come
and work for them. But those who leave always go back to their beloved
land as soon as they have earned what they need.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><br /><br />If you were to meet a Spanish person, you would find that he would be
interested in America and other countries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> but he couldn't imagine
living the rest of his life anywhere except in Spain. "Why should I ever
live anywhere else?" he would ask you. "Everything beautiful and good in
life is right here." He would feel this way even though he might be very
poor and might even have to leave for a little while, like the
shepherds. To him, the important things in life are his family, his
friends, his church and his country.</p>


<p>His country is a large, squarish, mountainous land at the
southwesternmost tip of Europe. To the north, over the tall wall of the
Pyrenees Mountains, is France. To the west is Portugal and the Atlantic
Ocean, and to the east is the Mediterranean Sea. Spain has more seacoast
than any other European country and more mountains than any except
Switzerland. Spain and Portugal together make up what is called the
Iberian Peninsula. It is named for the Iberian people who came there
from North Africa almost 5,000 years ago and settled down to become the
ancestors of the Spanish people.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks09.jpg" width="550" height="399" alt="" title="like the
shepherds" />
</div>

<p>If you were to stand at the bottom of the Iberian Peninsula, on a hill
overlooking a town called Algeciras, you could look right into Africa,
only twelve miles away. You would also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> see the Rock of Gibraltar&mdash;a
giant rock rising out of the sea and turned into a fort to guard the
narrow passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
This passage is the Strait of Gibraltar, and all ships must go through
it to get from the sea to the ocean.</p>

<p>In this mountainous country between two seas, more babies are born every
day than in any other country in Europe. There are 29 million people in
Spain already, although it is only the size of our state of Montana,
where 600,000 people live. This country might seem very small to us, but
it is the third largest country in Europe. And because their mountains
shut different parts of the country away from each other, there are many
differences in ways of living among the 29 million Spaniards. There are
15 different regions in Spain, and each one has a different way of
dressing, different music and dances, different ways of fixing food, a
different sort of house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> to live in, and even different ways of
speaking. Sometimes you will meet a Spaniard who has never been out of
his own region, or even away from his own village, because the mountains
make it very difficult to travel when your way of getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> around is on
your own two feet or in a little cart pulled by a small burro or donkey.</p>

<img src="images/double1.jpg" width="650" height="274" alt="" title="a little cart pulled by a small burro" />
</div>

<p>Another reason for the many different ways of living is that Spain is a
very old country which has been invaded many times by other countries.
These countries were jealous of the beauty and wealth of Spain and
wanted to get it for themselves. For hundreds of years the Spanish
people were always fighting to protect their beloved homeland against
invading armies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks17.jpg" width="550" height="328" alt="" title="viaduct" />
</div>

<p>The Iberians themselves were invaders, because they weren't the first
people who lived in Spain. We don't even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> know the names of those very
first people who lived there when most of Europe was covered with ice.
We only know that they lived in caves and hunted wild animals, because
some of their caves have been discovered and the walls are covered with
bright drawings of the animals these people hunted&mdash;bison, deer, wild
horses and wild boars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks18.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="" title="courtyard" />
</div>

<p>After the Iberians, came the Celts, Greeks, Phoenicians, Carthaginians
and Romans. From Rome, Spain took her language, her system of laws, and
her church. There were once more than 80 Roman cities in Spain, with
roads and bridges and walls which were built so well that they are still
used by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> Spanish people today. In the city of Segovia, the Romans built
an aqueduct to bring drinking water into the town from the nearby
mountains, and this aqueduct still brings water to the people of
Segovia.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks24.jpg" width="350" height="346" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p>The Romans liked Spain so much they stayed 500 years, but finally
barbaric tribes from central Europe drove them out. A short time later,
these tribes were conquered by Moors from North Africa. The Moors
brought many new ways to the Spanish people. They spoke the Arabic
language, and worshiped Mohammed instead of Christ, in churches called
mosques. They taught the Spanish people algebra and the science of
astronomy; they introduced a new kind of poetry, music and dancing. They
brought many new kinds of trees and flowers to Spain, like the date
palm, the orange and the pomegranate, and taught the people how to grow
them with an irrigation system which is still in use today. Many little
Spanish boys learn how to run it, so that they can help their fathers
and mothers.</p>

<p>The Moors built many mosques and palaces in Spain which are still in
use, and they look like buildings from Arabian fairy tales. These
Moorish buildings have their rooms built around open courtyards, called
patios, where orange and lemon trees and many bright flowers grow, and
fountains splash in the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>shine. The rooms have many pillars to
support the ceiling, and all the pillars and arches and ceilings are
beautifully carved. The Moors could carve hard stone so that it looks
like delicate lace, and this is what gives their buildings such a
fairy-tale look.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/double2.jpg" width="650" height="414" alt="" title="castle battlements" />
</div>

<p>The Spanish Christians, however, didn't like the Moors, and during all
of the 800 years the Moors ruled Spain, the Christians were fighting to
drive them out. Finally, Queen Isabella and her husband, King Ferdinand,
led their Christian army to victory against the last Moorish stronghold,
Granada. Because of this victory, Queen Isabella didn't have to worry
about fighting for a while, and she was able to help Columbus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>When Columbus discovered America on October 12, 1492, he began Spain's
most exciting period of history. The next century after Columbus was
called the Age of the Conquistadores. Conquistadores were adventurers
who set out to find and conquer new lands for Spain in the New World
which Columbus had discovered. Many of their conquests later became part
of the United States. For instance, De Soto claimed the Mississippi
River and all the rivers that run into it, as well as part of the land
that is now the American Southwest. Ponce de Leon, looking for a magic
fountain that would keep people young forever, discovered Florida and
claimed for Spain the land that is now the American southeast. Cortez,
who had conquered Mexico for Spain and had sent millions of dollars'
worth of gold and jewels back to his homeland, also traveled through the
Southwest and as far north as Colorado. The great Pacific Ocean, which
washes the western coast of both North and South America, was discovered
by a Spaniard named Balboa. One Spanish sailor, Juan Sebastian Elcano,
was the very first man to sail all the way around the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>The Conquistadores sent back a huge treasure of gold, silver, copper and
jewels to Spain, and more than paid Queen Isabella and her family for
her faith in Columbus. In fact, Spain became one of the most important
countries in Europe. Her queens and kings and princesses married rulers
of other countries so that soon, in addition to being very rich and
owning many countries across the ocean, Spain owned most of Europe too.
She was sitting on top of the world. Only England had stood up against
the Spanish power. So in 1588, Spain sent a great fleet of warships,
called the Armada, to challenge England. England won.</p>

<p>Spain never recovered from this defeat by England. It became harder for
her to govern the lands she had conquered. Today only two places outside
the country are still Spanish. They are the Canary Islands out in the
Atlantic Ocean near the coast of Africa, and the Balearic Islands in the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>At the same time that Spain was losing lands she had conquered, her own
lovely land tempted other countries, and the Spanish people were called
upon to fight invading armies from England and France. The real losers
during all these years of fighting were the Spanish people. They had to
fight instead of grow crops, and natural resources, like forests, were
neglected or used up. Spain fell further and further behind other
coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>tries, and even today she hasn't been able to catch up as far as
she would like.</p>

<p>All the unhappy years of fighting in Spain weren't in the long-ago past.
Just a while ago, in 1936, a Civil War broke out between the Spanish
people who wanted their king to come back to the throne he'd left in
1931, and the people who wanted Spain to set up a republic, like ours in
the United States. This war went on for three years, and in the end,
everybody lost. General Francisco Franco and his army defeated the
forces which wanted a republic, and also those who wanted to set up
Communism. He is now the head of the Spanish government. Because he is
considered a dictator, there are many Spanish people who disagree with
the way he runs the government and are hoping to change it. In 1947 a
new constitution was written in which General Franco agreed that Spain
would one day have a king again, but the person who becomes king must be
at least twenty-five years old. The old king is dead and there is nobody
for the job right now. But the king's grandson, young Prince Juan
Carlos, is taking special studies so he will be ready to be king when he
is old enough. And of course there are still people who would like to
see Spain become a democratic republic, like the United States, and not
have a king at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks25.jpg" width="550" height="402" alt="" title="Fisherman" />
</div>

<p>In the meantime, the Spanish people and their government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> have a lot to
do to make their country stable and strong again. If you were to visit
Spain, you would see why the Spanish people love their country so much.
You could also understand why so many different nations wanted to
conquer Spain. Spain is a very beautiful country and also a country that
can produce many good things. It has minerals such as iron, lead, copper
and sulphur in the earth. In the south, it has a warm climate that helps
grow luscious crops of oranges, lemons, olives and grapes for wine.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>You might like to take a trip from one region to another by riding on a
little donkey as Spanish boys do, or in a little high-wheeled cart
pulled by a donkey, the way little Spanish girls might do. Your donkey
would probably not have a saddle, but just a rug or a straw mat folded
across his back, and he might wear a headband of bright red and blue
wool woven into a gay pattern to shade his eyes from the sun. You could
carry your food and clothes for the journey in a pair of straw bags hung
one on each side of your donkey's back. Along the way, you would see
dozens of other little donkeys and burros. The burro is a donkey-cousin
but even smaller. Donkeys and burros work with the Spanish men and boys
in the fields or carry stones to help build new roads, or carry jars of
water from a well to someone's house. These gentle little animals work
to earn their keep in Spain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>



<p>Suppose you start your trip in the north. At the very most northwestern
tip of Spain is the region of Galicia, which everybody thought was the
end of the world before Columbus showed them it wasn't. People in
Galicia call themselves "Gallegos," and they live in a country of rocky
seacoasts, where the ocean pokes long fingers called "rias" back into
green hills and fog rolls in almost every day. In Galicia and the
neighboring region of Asturias, fathers earn their living by fishing or
by farming, and mothers make all the clothes for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> their families from
cloth they weave themselves. Families live in houses built from stones
cleared from their own fields. This is where the bagpipes are played
while the young people, gaily dressed in red and green, dance their
lively dances.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks27.jpg" width="550" height="334" alt="" title="dancing" />
</div>

<p>This northern region is quite different from the sunny south, where the
climate is very hot in the summer and never really gets cold in the
winter. Here in the south is Andalusia, where mountain ranges may have
snow on their peaks all year round, but down in the valleys and plains
sweet-scented tropical flowers bloom in bright colors every single
month. On the hillsides, grapes are grown to make wine, or silvery-green
olive trees make groves against the red earth. This is a region of
horses and good horsemen. Here big ranches stretch along the river banks
and huge black bulls are raised.</p>


<p>The people of Andalusia are full of music, dancing and the love of life.
They live in white houses built around courtyards full of flowers, with
windows covered with designs in black wrought iron. Black-haired
Andalusian women wear black lace mantillas draped over their heads, a
kind of veil and shawl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> They like to carry lacy fans and wear long
flashing earrings. Lots of gypsies live in Andalusia, many of them in
caves in the chalky-white hillsides. Gypsy girls wear long red or green
or blue dresses dotted with white. They fold bright-colored silk fringed
scarves around their necks, and they love to wear many gold bracelets.
Andalusia is the region the Moors loved the most, so this is where
you'll see many of their lovely stone buildings full of lacelike
carvings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks28.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="" title="Spanish artefacts" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>It's like going into another world to journey from Andalusia into
western Spain. In Extremadura, the land where the Conquistadores lived,
and in Le&oacute;n, there are great sweeping plains where the land is not very
fertile because there are long dry seasons. Raising sheep, fruit and
pigs are the main sources of making a living, and the people must work
very hard. They don't have time for as much fun as the Andalusians do.
These people are quiet but proud. They are especially proud of their
universities, libraries and cathedrals.</p>

</div>


<p>Still another little world in this country of contrasts is found in the
eastern part of Spain, along the Mediterranean coast and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> in the region
inland from this coast. The coastal regions are called, from north to
south, Catalonia, Valencia and Murcia, all very pretty names. Catalonia
has a long seacoast which is cut by many bays and coves reaching back
right into the mountains, which rise straight from the sea. Many white
sand beaches, rimmed with pine trees, invite you to stop and swim and
sun. If you stopped, you could have fun climbing around the ruins of old
walls and watchtowers on the hills looking out to sea. Once upon a time
on these hills, lookouts used to give warning when pirates were sailing
up to plunder the villages. One of these Catalonian villages, called
Tossa de Mar, has a whole village built inside the walls on top of a
hill above the regular village. People used to gather in this hilltop
hide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>out for protection against pirates. The second largest city in
Spain, Barcelona, is in Catalonia, and it has a very busy harbor where
ships of all nations sail in and out every day.</p>

<p>Valencia, south of Catalonia, is a land of flowers. Carnations, roses,
jasmine, scarlet bougainvillea vines, and orange and lemon blossoms fill
the air with perfume. Every Spaniard loves flowers, and every window and
courtyard is full of blos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>soms. In the city of Valencia there's a Battle
of Flowers every year during one of their festivals. Great baskets of
rose petals and carnations line the streets and everyone dips out
handfuls to toss over his neighbors and friends. You can imagine that in
a very short time the whole city looks as if it were paved with flowers.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/double3.jpg" width="650" height="335" alt="" title="harbour" />
</div>

<p>In Sitges, a small fishing village a few miles north of Valencia where
the most beautiful carnations in Spain are grown, there is a Carnation
Festival every June, and here the main square actually <i>is</i> paved with
flower petals, laid out in gorgeous designs for the occasion. The land
in the region of Valencia is so fertile that, with the help of the
irrigation system set up long ago by the Moors, the people today grow as
many as four crops a year of rice, vegetables, melons and oranges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Murcia has a small bit of seacoast, but the rest of it is mostly desert
land where the earth looks like chalk-dust. It gets so hot people can't
go out in the middle of the day. They stay indoors in the cool darkness
as much as possible. Murcia is very much like North Africa, and in some
of the old towns the women still wear heavy veils over their faces the
way the Moors from North Africa did. You wouldn't be at all surprised to
see a camel train in the chalky dust of the dry river bed, but instead,
it's just another procession of little donkeys carrying goods to market
in their straw saddlebags, driven by men hiding under huge hats from the
burning sun.</p>

<p>The regions of Navarre and Aragon, in the northeast, are quite different
from Murcia's desert. They have a rich, mountainous countryside with the
tall Pyrenees marching across the north. Many wild animals are found in
these regions, including some which are rare in other parts of the
world, like the chamois, the ibex, the wild boar, bears, several kinds
of deer, and the great golden eagle. Like other northern regions of
Spain, there's snow in the winter and people go sledding and skiing.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks34.jpg" width="295" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Just to the north are the Basque Provinces, on the southern slopes of
the Pyrenees and stretching along the Bay of Biscay. The Basque people
are known as the "Mystery Men of Europe," because nobody is sure where
they came from. Nobody knows where the strange language they speak came
from either. We do know that they are a very ancient people, perhaps
direct descendants of the original Iberians. The Basques are fearless
and daring, and are noted throughout the world as excellent sailors and
sheep-herders. When you visit the Basques, you will notice that they all
like to eat enormous meals, they like to gamble, and they like to play
"jai alai," a very fast ball game which they invented.</p>



<p>"Jai alai" means "happy festival" in the Basque language, and the game
is a very exciting and happy one. The ball, slightly smaller than a
baseball, is very hard and can travel very fast. Players have curved
baskets attached to their right wrists, and they must scoop up or catch
the ball in these baskets and immediately throw it and try to hit a
certain spot marked off on the wall. If it doesn't hit the right spot,
the opposing team scores a point. If it hits the right spot, the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
team must try to scoop it up before it bounces and send it back, hitting
a certain spot on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>You can see that it can be a very fast and complicated game. You could
see jai alai played in specially built concrete courts in many cities in
Spain, also in the state of Florida, right here in our own country. A
jai alai court is called a "fronton." But in the Basque country you'd
see all the men and boys in the village playing jai alai back of the
church, using the high stone wall as their court. Girls don't play it
very often, but when they do it is a very pretty sight, because they
wear wide skirts of blue or red with many white petticoats underneath.
When they run and turn to hit the ball, their skirts swing around wildly
and make them look like spinning tops.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks35.jpg" width="550" height="303" alt="" title="castle" />
</div>
<p>Completely different from the Basque country and all other regions is
the central part of Spain. It is a high plateau bordered by still higher
rugged rocky mountains. The weather is very hot in summer and very cold
in winter, with scorching or icy winds blasting across the land because
there are no forests to break their force. Great gray boulders thrust
out of purple-green hillsides, and rivers cut deep gorges in the gray
soil. This central part is made up of two regions, Old and New Castile.
Old Castile is to the north, and cattle are raised in the green fields
fed by mountain streams.</p>

<p>Castile means "land of castles," and both Old and New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> Castile have
cities built around castles and cathedrals, sometimes surrounded by
walls built during the years of warfare. One of these cities in Castile
is Avila, which has high stone walls so thick that four or five soldiers
could march side by side on top all the way around the city. There are
88 round towers rising from these walls, where sentries and lookouts
were posted, but only 16 ways to get in and out, so that the city could
be guarded more easily.</p>


<p>Not far from Avila is the famous palace of El Escorial, where most of
the kings and queens of Spain are buried. Castile isn't the only part of
Spain with castles, of course. If you were visiting Spain today, you
could stay overnight in many of these castles and pretend you were a
king or queen of lovely Spain. These castles made into hotels are called
"paradores," and a visit to one of them is great fun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Because Castile is in the very heart of Spain, the capital, Madrid, is
located there. Madrid is a lively, bustling, modern city of more than
1&frac12; million people. It is the highest capital in Europe, being almost
half a mile above sea level in the center of the great mesa or tableland
of Castile. Madrid is not a very old city compared with such ancient
cities as Avila, but it has an old section built around the Plaza
Mayor&mdash;the main square&mdash;where steps lead down into winding, narrow
streets with arches and covered sidewalks. The larger part of Madrid is
a modern city with wide boulevards lined with trees, where people can
sit at sidewalk terrace caf&eacute;s sipping coffee or wine or lemonade and
watching other people streaming by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks37.jpg" width="550" height="256" alt="" title="castle" />
</div>

<p>Sometimes it seems that everybody in Madrid lives outdoors all the time,
because there are always so many people on the streets all day and all
night. Meals are served very late&mdash;lunch is at 2 o'clock or later, and
dinner not until about 10. Concerts, plays and movies don't start until
11 o'clock at night, or even midnight. Even very young children and
babies stay up late with their parents, to visit with friends at a
sidewalk caf&eacute; or to go to a movie. Only in the middle of the day, when
it is hot, everybody goes indoors for a long nap. This is called a
"siesta," and during siesta time the streets of Madrid and all other
Spanish cities are deserted. Shops and offices are closed. There is
almost no traffic on the streets and boulevards. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> 1 to 5 every
afternoon, a stranger in Spain might think that a great calamity had
happened and made Spain a land of sleeping princes and princesses.</p>

<p>After siesta, the streets wake to an even more bustling life than
before. Offices and stores open again to serve their customers until 7
or 8 o'clock at night. The sidewalk caf&eacute;s and restaurants become busier
than ever. Every chair is taken, and the conversation goes on at such a
fast rate that unless you understood Spanish very well, you could be
lost in the rushing sound of it.</p>

<p>Spain has other proud cities besides Madrid. Two, whose history goes way
back to the days of the Moors, are Granada and Toledo.</p>

<p>Granada is the city in Andalusia which the Moors loved most and held
longest. They fought hard to keep it, and when they finally surrendered
it to Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492 they wept bitterly, for it seemed
to them they had lost a Paradise. The great fortress-palace of the Moors
in Granada is called the Alhambra, which means "red castle." About a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
hundred years ago an American author, Washington Irving, went to live in
the Alhambra. He found the romantic castle very much as the Moors had
left it, except for the dust which hadn't been removed in 400 years. He
walked through the echoing corridors and into the moonlit courtyards
with their silent fountains. He talked with dozens of old Spanish and
gypsy storytellers to learn all he could about the Alhambra. He even
claimed he could see the ghosts of the sultans who had once lived there.
Then he wrote a book, <i>Tales of the Alhambra</i>, which we can still read
and enjoy. Because of his book, the Alhambra was cleaned and restored to
all its former beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks38.jpg" width="321" height="400" alt="" title="Alhambra detail" />
</div>

<p>Today the carved white and golden stonework of this castle shines with
the splendor of long ago. One of its most interesting courtyards is
called the Court of the Lions. Twelve very old stone lions, each with a
different expression on his face, stand in a circle in the center,
supporting the curved bowl of a fountain on their backs. Out of each
lion's mouth trickles a little stream of water, helping to cool the air.
Everyone who visits the Alhambra loves these funny old lions and goes
away with a picture of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks39.jpg" width="435" height="550" alt="" title="the Alhambra" />
</div>


<p>The Moorish sultans entertained their guests and held big parties in
courtyards like this one. But they lived with their families and
servants in another part of the Alhambra, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> gardens and a sparkling
pool where the royal ladies bathed. Looking out through certain of the
arching, carved windows, the sultans could see the snow-covered Sierra
Nevada Mountains. The Sierra Nevada peaks have snow the year round, even
in the hottest summers. When the Moors lived in the Alhambra,
swift-running slaves would bring snow from the mountains to make sherbet
for the sultans and their guests in hot weather.</p>

<p>From other windows in the Alhambra the sultans could see Sacro
Monte&mdash;the Holy Mountain&mdash;where gypsies still live today in whitewashed
caves. Many centuries ago the gypsies didn't have homes, but wandered
throughout the world. When some of them came to Granada, they fell in
love with the city and decided to stay. Now there are thousands of them
living in Andalusia, many of them in Sacro Monte. Their cave-homes are
really quite comfortable. Many have fine copper cooking pots hanging on
the walls and beautiful works of art, and hangings of hand-woven
fabrics. If you go to Granada, you can visit a gypsy cave and the
gypsies will dance for you to a kind of music which is called
"flamenco." Nobody knows where the flamenco came from, but some say it
is as old as the Phoenicians, and some say&mdash;even older.</p>

<p>Toledo is another old, old city in Spain&mdash;at one time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> capital.
Toledo is built on a series of hills above a river, called Tagus, which
winds around the base of the city like a natural moat around a fortress.
Nearly four hundred years ago a Greek painter came to Toledo and stayed
to become one of Spain's&mdash;and the world's&mdash;greatest artists. He was
known as "El Greco," which means The Greek, and today most people have
forgotten his real name.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have seen his famous painting of the city he loved, called
"View of Toledo." If you have, you know what Toledo looks like today,
for it has changed very little since El Greco painted it. You could take
your crayons or paints to the same spot across the River Tagus where he
stood with his canvas and easel, and you would see the same rapids in
the river, the same arched gateways in the city walls, the same
cathedral spire rising from a hill.</p>

<p>Then you could cross an old bridge, and go through a Moorish gateway
into town. Walking along a cobblestone street, you might pass an old
church which has iron chains hanging on its walls. These are the chains
of Christian slaves captured by Moors, then freed by Christian armies.</p>

<p>At the top of one hill you would discover an old house with red tiled
roof and a garden full of roses, geraniums, mimosa, Jasmine and
oleanders. This is the house where El Greco lived,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> and you'd see his
easel, his bedroom, his kitchen and furniture just as he left them. In a
small museum next to the house you'd find paintings by El Greco, mostly
pictures of saints and portraits of famous Spaniards of his time. One of
his paintings is in a chapel in town and others are in other churches
throughout Spain, and in the Prado Museum in Madrid, along with those of
other great Spanish painters like Valesquez, Goya and Murillo.</p>

<p>The people of Toledo have a special art of their own&mdash;making fine
jewelry called "Toledo ware." The Moors brought the knack from the
ancient city of Damascus. Threads of gold and silver are woven into
intricate patterns with fine steel. When the piece is put into a hot
furnace, the steel part of the pattern turns black, then the gold and
silver designs are polished until they shine. Originally the Moors made
their big swords this way, but today Toledo ware is bracelets, earrings,
cuff links and other small jewelry.</p>

<p>The people of Toledo also make glistening glazed tiles. Some of these
show scenes from the lives of favorite Spanish heroes, real and
imaginary. There are some Toledo tiles that will tell you about Don
Quixote of La Mancha, a hero invented 350 years ago by Miguel Cervantes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks43.jpg" width="456" height="550" alt="" title="Don
Quixote of La Mancha" />
</div>


<p>Cervantes wanted to tease his fellow countrymen about reading so many
books with stories that could never happen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> in real life. So he wrote a
book of his own about Don Quixote, a foolish old fellow who imagined he
was a handsome knight. The poor Don rode all around the country on a
rickety old horse dreaming he was rescuing beautiful ladies and
fighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> imaginary battles for his king. Once he even tried to fight a
windmill, thinking it was a giant! Another time he thought a shepherd
and his flock were an army!</p>

<p>Cervantes' fun-poking book is still read and laughed over by people
throughout the whole world. Today, if you were to drive from Granada to
Toledo or Madrid, you would pass through Don Quixote's country, La
Mancha, and you would see windmills and the shepherds leading their
sheep and goats, with all the countryside looking much as Cervantes
described it through Don Quixote's eyes.</p>

<p>Wherever you stopped for the night, you would see a great
walking-around, which begins at 7 o'clock. Every family comes out to
join in this evening custom which is called "paseo." Of course the
children come too, dressed in their best clothes. But boys and girls do
not walk together. Two or three girls will walk by, arm-in-arm, and
several boys will walk by, talking together and looking at the girls
from the corner of their eyes. In the smaller places, all the older boys
walk together in one direction while all the older girls walk arm-in-arm
in the opposite direction, or else on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>Just as boys and girls don't walk together in the paseo, they don't
often play games together either&mdash;at least not after they are old enough
to go to school. Before school days start,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> all children play singing
and dancing games something like our "London Bridge." They play tag and
a favorite game called "Hit the Pot." They put a tin can or an old clay
pot on the end of a long stick and blindfold the child who is "It." The
others then run around with the stick while "It" tries to knock off the
can with another stick. But when they are six years old, all little boys
and girls must go to school, and&mdash;except in small villages where there
are only a few children to study with one teacher&mdash;they go to separate
schools, so they stop playing together then, too.</p>

<p>Little girls jump rope, play with jacks and dolls. Or they play singing
games which act out the parts of kings and queens and princesses. Little
boys are most interested in games with balls, like jai alai or football.</p>

<p>The favorite game of most little boys in Spain is "Torero." In this game
they pretend they are bullfighters, who are called "toreros." Every boy
in Spain dreams of growing up to be the greatest bullfighter in the
world. Bullfighting is one of the most exciting things in life to every
Spaniard.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks45.jpg" width="387" height="400" alt="" title="favorite game of most little boys in Spain is Torero." />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Every big city has a great bullring, a round building with many steps of
seats and no roof, called the "Plaza de Toros." "Toro" is the bull. The
bulls are especially bred for the ring, because no ordinary cow or bull
would be able to take part in this colorful pageant. Almost every Sunday
afternoon throughout the year, and at holiday times, there is a
"corrida" or bullfight, and everybody goes to see the toreros fight the
bulls.</p>

<p>Bullfighters in Spain are the same heroes to Spanish boys and girls that
baseball players are to American youngsters. This is the reason why
you'll see all the little Spanish boys playing Torero. One pretends he
is the toro and wears a basket over his head as he charges at the one
pretending he is the torero with a red cape and wooden sword.</p>

<p>Although Spanish children like to play, they are also very serious about
schoolwork, because they know that if Spain is to be a wise member of
the family of nations, she needs educated citizens. During the Civil War
it was very hard for young people to get an education, and some of the
schools and universities were destroyed by bombs or fires. Now the
universities have been rebuilt, and more schools are being built every
year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks47.jpg" width="550" height="503" alt="" title="Some boys and girls go to schools run by their church" />
</div>

<p>Some boys and girls go to schools run by their church,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> and they are
taught by priests and nuns. According to law, everyone must go to school
until the age of fourteen. Then, if the family can afford it, they can
go on to higher schools and the university. If the family is poor but a
boy is very bright, he may win a scholarship by getting high marks.
Because boys are more likely than girls to go to a university, they
study more science and mathematics in school than their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> sisters do. Of
course they all study reading, writing, history, arithmetic and good
manners.</p>

<p>When a Spanish boy grows up and has a university education, he may
become a doctor, lawyer, banker, newspaperman or government worker, just
as any of you may. If he is going to be a farmer, a fisherman, or
fashion things with his hands as a carpenter or wrought-iron maker does,
he probably won't go to school after he is fourteen. If he's going to do
the same thing his father does, his father will teach him. Otherwise, he
may become an apprentice, which means that he will work right along with
grownups who already do what he wants to learn. He learns by doing it
with them.</p>

<p>Little Spanish girls, who wear pinafores to school and do their hair in
pigtails, are more interested in learning how to be good mothers,
because every little Spanish girl dreams of marrying and having lots of
children. They learn how to read and write, and the history of their
country, but they also learn how to cook and sew and bring up children.</p>

<p>Recently some Spanish girls have started learning how to be lawyers,
doctors and teachers. These girls, like their brothers, go on to
universities. Some girls also learn shorthand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> and typing so that they
can work in offices. Before the Civil War there were no girls in
offices, but today they like being secretaries and typists just as girls
in America do. Still, even these modern Spanish girls don't have the
freedom to go to parties or on dates with boys, the way American girls
do, unless they are engaged to be married. When they go out at night for
the paseo or to attend the theater or a movie, they go with other girls
or with their whole family.</p>

<p>A strong family bond unites all Spanish people. Fathers and mothers and
children spend as much time together as they possibly can. If being
together means that children must go with parents into the fields at
harvest time, then they go, even if they only play around and don't
really help. In the evenings when the father and mother go to the paseo
or sit in a caf&eacute; to talk with their friends, their children go with
them.</p>

<p>Always the whole family goes to church together. One of the most
important days in a Spanish child's life is the day of confirmation.
Then the family and relatives and friends from miles around come to
celebrate. All over Spain, on a Sunday morning, you'll see the little
girls in their long white dresses with white gloves and veils, looking
proud and happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> as they walk to church with their beaming mothers and
fathers for their confirmation. When boys are confirmed, they wear white
suits, with a cape lined in scarlet or blue satin and trimmed with gold
braid. If the family has enough money, they may hire a horse-drawn
carriage. The driver wears a tall black stovepipe silk hat and the
carriage doors and horses' bridles are decorated with white flowers.</p>

<p>The church is very important in Spanish life. The Apostle James himself
came to preach in Spain, and later, after he had been killed in
Palestine, his body was brought back to Spain for burial. His tomb is in
the beautiful Cathedral of Santiago&mdash;which is the way Spanish people say
St. James&mdash;in Compostela, in northern Spain. For thousands of years
people from all over the world have come as pilgrims to Compostela. Many
little Spanish boys are named Santiago, or perhaps Jaime, another way to
say James in Spanish, for Santiago is the patron saint of all Spain.</p>

<p>Every city and village also has its very own private patron saint. Once
a year there is a village festival or "fiesta" in his or her honor. If
you were to travel through Spain you would find a fiesta somewhere every
day of the year! These fiestas start in the morning when all the people
go to church, which is always decorated with hundreds of flowers and
candles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> Then in the afternoon or evening there is a long parade from
the church through the main streets and back to the church again, with
the figure of the saint standing on a flower-draped platform which is
carried on the shoulders of young men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks51.jpg" width="550" height="358" alt="" title="Bull fight" />
</div>

<p>Choirs sing, candles and incense burn, and all the people stand in
reverence along the route. A bullfight is usually a feature of a saint's
day too, with the whole town going to the Plaza de Toros to watch. The
paseo will be especially gay at fiesta time, and as darkness falls, the
guitars will start to twang, castanets will click and all the young
people will gather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> in the main square to take part in folk dances until
morning. Sometimes the saint's fiesta will last a whole week, with
bullfights every afternoon and a fair every night.</p>

<p>One of the most unusual fiestas in all Spain is held every March in
Valencia in honor of St. Joseph. It is called the "Fallas de San Jos&eacute;"
because of the huge, grotesque figures called "fallas" which are the
main feature of the celebration. Every club and religious group in the
city spends weeks in advance of St. Joseph's Day building these figures
out of papier-m&agrave;ch&eacute;, and each group tries to keep its design secret
until the fiesta takes place. The best falla wins a prize, and at the
end of the three-day celebration, all the fallas except the prize-winner
are burned in a big bonfire while the people dance around it and
fireworks are shot into the sky.</p>

<p>Of all holidays, Christmas is one of the merriest in Spanish homes.
"Noche Buena," or Christmas Eve, is a time for families to sit down to a
wonderful feast. The mothers and older sisters of the family have been
preparing this feast for months, and fathers have been collecting the
best Spanish wines to store away until now. Turkey is the traditional
dish at Spanish Christmas dinners just as it is here. But Christmas is
one of the few times turkey is ever served in most Spanish homes, so it
is really a special treat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Spicy hams, stuffed roast lamb, and special fish dishes are also served
with the roast turkey. And no Christmas table would be complete without
"turrones"&mdash;a candy made of honey and almonds, something like our
nougats. Dried figs and grapes, walnuts and hazelnuts load the table
even more. After dinner, the family goes to midnight services at church
called "Misa de Gallo"; then they come home and celebrate until morning.</p>

<p>There are no Christmas trees in Spain, but each family makes its own
Nativity scene, which is set out in time for Christmas Eve. In some
cities contests are held for the most beautiful "Belen" scenes, as they
are called, because "Belen" is the way Spanish people say Bethlehem. On
Christmas Day everybody goes calling to see the Belens in other people's
houses.</p>

<p>Sometimes grownups exchange gifts on Christmas Day, but Spanish children
don't receive their gifts until January 6, Three King's Day. Instead of
Santa Claus, the Three Wise Men, Melchior, Gaspar and Balthasar leave
gifts in the children's shoes. The shoes are set out in a window or near
the fireplace, filled with hay so the camels of the Three Kings may
feast. In the morning the hay is gone and toys, nuts, fruit and candy
have taken its place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Holy Week, the week starting with Palm Sunday and ending with Easter, is
another important time in Spanish life. On Palm Sunday, everyone
throughout the country has palm branches from Elche, an old town where
the only palm grove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> in Europe grows. After carrying the branches in
processions through the streets and into the churches and cathedrals,
people hang them on the balconies of their houses, where they remain
until the fresh palm branches of the next year replace them.</p>

<p>The most colorful celebration of Holy Week is held in Seville, a city in
sunny Andalusia. Every night there are processions of robed and hooded
men moving silently through streets lined with thousands of men, women
and children. All the figures of saints and Madonnas from all the
churches and the Cathedral are carried in one procession or another. The
figures are dressed in costly vestments and jewels, and the procession
is lighted by flickering torches and candles. As the figures pass
beneath balconies crowded with watchers, a singer will suddenly break
into a spontaneous, unaccompanied song, called a "saeta," to salute the
saint being carried by. The saeta is the same sort of song the Moors
used to sing when they lived in Seville and other cities in Andalusia,
and today it is usually sung by gypsies, thousands of whom live here.</p>

<p>Night after night these processions go on, until Good Friday, when the
most gorgeous one of all starts at 3 o'clock in the morning. This is the
procession of the Virgin of Macarena, the patron saint of bullfighters
and all Seville. The Virgin is dressed up in robes of silver and gold
and wears jewels given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> by famous bullfighters and wealthy people. The
men who march in this procession wear costumes of rich red and gold, and
there is an honor guard dressed like ancient Roman centurions. The
"Macarena" is the most popular saint in Seville, and everyone watches
her procession until it takes her back to her shrine in the gypsy
section, Triana, followed by thousands of gaily clad gypsies who spend
the rest of the night singing and dancing to the throbbing of guitars.</p>

<p>Shortly after Holy Week, Seville has another gay festival, this time
called a "feria," which is rather like a big country fair. For two weeks
everybody celebrates all day and all night, singing and dancing and
visiting friends for a glass of wine. Every day there is a bullfight,
and at night there are concerts, dance and art shows, and plays. The
huge fair grounds blaze with light, and ferris wheels and
merry-go-rounds spin gaily round and round.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, the feria was an auction for horses and cattle, and
today it is still a time when the best horsemen show off their fine
horses and their skill at riding. During the feria, the proud horsemen
wear leather aprons something like our cowboys' chaps over their tight
gray riding pants. Their bolero jackets are black trimmed with braid,
and their hats are black too, the flat, wide-brimmed felt hats which
horsemen always wear in Spain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Horses are curried until they shine, and flowers and ribbons are twined
in their manes and tails and decorate their bridles. Beautiful
black-haired girls dress up like gypsies, something they would not be
allowed to do at any other time. As the girls ride in the saddles behind
their young men, the long, flounced, polka-dotted skirts of red, green
or blue fall down over the horse's side. Black lace mantillas are draped
over very tall combs in their hair, and a gay flower is usually pinned
behind one ear. Every carriage, every farm cart, every house and every
person is decorated with flowers.</p>

<p>At harvest time, when olives, grapes, fruit or grain are brought in from
the land, there is much merry-making, too. At Jerez de la Frontera, a
sunny town in Andalusia where everybody works at growing grapes and
making them into a famous wine called sherry, the harvest festival comes
just before the grapes are ready to be harvested, in September.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/ddgtks57.jpg" width="270" height="400" alt="" title="harvest time" />
</div>

<p>High-wheeled vineyard carts decorated with vines and flowers are pulled,
by sturdy oxen, out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> every vineyard in the countryside, carrying all
the pretty girls who work there and a basket of new grapes. The carts
wind through the streets to the Cathedral, where the grapes are blessed
and all the people pray and give thanks for a good harvest. Then, in the
square in front of the Cathedral, a great flock of pigeons is loosed
into the air. These are homing pigeons, and they fly back to their homes
in every part of Spain, carrying the message that the harvest is about
to begin. There's dancing in the streets all night, and the next day
there are bullfights, races and more dancing. Then the people all go to
work to harvest the grapes.</p>


<p>On Spanish holidays, there is plenty to eat and drink. For visitors,
eating is fun even on any ordinary day. If you were to travel from
region to region in Spain, you would notice that people eat different
foods in different places. Along the seacoasts, of course, they eat many
kinds of fish. In the north,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> one of the favorite seafood dishes is made
of codfish cooked in a delicious sauce of red and green peppers flavored
with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> garlic. In Valencia you would eat "paella" made of many kinds of
shellfish, chicken, ham and rice flavored with saffron, a yellow spice
which grows in Spain. Paella is made in a big round iron pan over a
charcoal fire, and the little clams, shrimps, pieces of chicken and
everything else that makes it good are tossed in, a handful at a time,
until the whole dish is ready to be served, right from the pan it was
cooked in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/double4.jpg" width="650" height="359" alt="" title="horse and cart" />
</div>

<p>Most families have a big lunch, at about 2 o'clock. If the weather is
cool, this is very likely to be a pot of stew, or "cocido." Depending on
what part of the country you are in, this cocido might be made of fish,
lamb, beef or chicken. Whatever the meat or fish may be, the cocido also
includes all the vegetables that grow in the garden at that time of
year. It's apt to be flavored with garlic, sweet Spanish red peppers,
and perhaps several spoonfuls of sherry wine.</p>

<p>In the hot summer weather in Andalusia, people eat a delicious cold soup
as their main dish at lunch, and sometimes at dinner too. This soup is
called <i>gazpacho</i>, and it is made with Spanish olive oil, vinegar,
tomato juice and ice water. Very fine bread crumbs help make it thick,
and little pieces of fresh, cold tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers,
olives and onions float on top.</p>

<p>Everybody in Spain eats a great many "churros." Churros are something
like doughnuts, but they are twisted into odd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> shapes and fried in olive
oil until they are crisp all the way through, not just on the outside.
They are very fine for breakfast with hot chocolate, and they are also
good with sugar sprinkled on them as a between-meals snack. Another
snack is almonds, grown right in Spain, and shrimp the size of your
little finger.</p>

<p>Some of the foods the Spanish children eat are the same ones their
great-great-great-grandfathers and mothers ate, too. Mostly, the houses
where they live are also very old&mdash;as old as the holiday customs that
haven't changed in hundreds of years. These old ways and scenes are some
of the reasons Spain has been called "the land where time stands still."</p>

<p>Only just now is this old Spain about to become modern Spain. New roads,
railroads and airfields are being built to help people get around the
country faster and to send food from farms and seacoasts to markets in a
hurry. All over Spain you hear the sound of hammers and chisels, busily
building a new life for the people.</p>

<p>Spain has joined the United Nations and Spanish boys and girls are eager
to join all boys and girls who want their countries to be partners in
progress. If, in getting to know Spain, you have learned to like it,
perhaps you'll want to say "hello" and "good luck" to your Spanish
friends. Here is how to say it: "Saludos, amigos!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="History" id="History"></a>History</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Before 200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;Earliest people lived in caves in northern Spain;
were conquered by Iberians, then Celts. Phoenicians and Greeks
came, and finally all were conquered by Carthaginians.</p>

<p>201 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;Romans conquered Carthaginians, began a rule lasting more
than 500 years.</p>

<p>406 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&mdash;Barbarians, especially Visigoths, came into Spain from
central Europe and eventually drove out the Romans.</p>

<p>711 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&mdash;The Moors came from North Africa and conquered all Spain
in less than 10 years. Although the Christian Spaniards started
fighting almost immediately for the "Reconquest" of Spain, the
Moors were masters for almost 800 years.</p>

<p>January 2, 1492&mdash;The Reconquest of Spain was completed when the
armies of Ferdinand and Isabella drove the Moors out of the
Alhambra in Granada, their last stronghold.</p>

<p>August, 1492&mdash;Columbus sailed with his three ships from Palos in an
effort to reach the Far East by sailing west; on October 12, he
made his first landfall in the New World and claimed it for Spain.</p>

<p>1492-1588&mdash;The Golden Age of Spain. Columbus discovered more lands
in the New World, and Conquistadores planted the Spanish flag all
through North and South America. Spain controlled most of Europe.
It was a time of great artists and writers like Velasquez, El
Greco, Murillo, Lope de Vega and Cervantes.</p>

<p>1588&mdash;Spain's great naval Armada was defeated by England and the
power of Spain began to decline throughout the world. Last overseas
possessions were lost at the end of the Spanish-American War in
1898.</p>

<p>1931&mdash;King Alfonso XIII abdicated from his throne, went into exile;
Spain became a republic.</p>

<p>1936-1939&mdash;The Spanish Civil War. Nationalists led by General
Francisco Franco won the war and the General became Chief of State.</p>

<p>1947&mdash;The Law of Succession was adopted by Spanish Parliament,
providing for a future King and new Spanish monarchy; this law
altered in 1956 so that the monarchy may be established sooner than
originally planned.</p>

<p>1953&mdash;American aid program began; airfields, pipelines and other
construction projects using American money and American builders
help Spain develop a defense network and natural resources.</p>

<p>1956&mdash;Spain admitted to the United Nations. </p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
